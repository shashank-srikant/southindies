Enjoy recipes of traditional, home-made Indian food. 

## Motivation
* **Preserve**: To document everyday recipes, the fruits of which we've enjoyed since we have been kids. Some of these dishes are very local to certain regions - putting it online will help preserve the knowledge
* **Be beginner-friendly**: To move away from jargon and fancy terms and make this really simple for beginners to accurately replicate taste
* **Multiple cuisines**: Southindies may be a misnomer as the site can surely accommodate cuisines from different geographies. But the motivational roots can be traced to south Indian delicacies.
* **Redundancy?**: There may be several other sites which probably provide similar information. But the authors of this blog believe that there are nuances in taste and texture across house-holds. This is to preserve and document what has been _engineered_ in the authors' households.
