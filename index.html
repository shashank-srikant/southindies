<h2>Welcome to southindies.in</h2>
This site will contains recipes of traditional home-made dishes. Stay tuned.
<br/><br/>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Preserve</b>: To document everyday recipes, the fruits of which we've enjoyed since we have been kids. Some of these dishes are very local to certain regions - putting it online will help preserve the knowledge</li>
<li><b>Be beginner-friendly</b>: To move away from jargon and fancy terms and make this really simple for beginners.</li>
<li><b>Multiple cuisines</b>: <i>Southindies</i> may be a misnomer as the site can surely accommodate cuisines from different geographies. The motivational roots for setting this website however is attributed to documenting south Indian preparations.</li>
<li><b>Redundancy?</b>: There may be several other sites which probably provide similar information. But the authors of this blog believe that there are nuances in taste and texture across house-holds. This is to preserve and document what has been <i>engineered</i> in the authors' households.</li>
